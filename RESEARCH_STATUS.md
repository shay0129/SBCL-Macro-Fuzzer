# SBCL Macro Isolation Research - Current Findings

## Summary of Tests Conducted

### 1. Variable Collision Test Results
‚úÖ **SBCL Successfully Isolates Variables**
- Original variables remain unchanged after macro execution
- Macro variables with same names don't affect parent scope
- Proper lexical scoping maintained

### 2. Attack Vector Testing
‚úÖ **Scope Isolation Holds Strong**
- Collision attacks fail to hijack parent variables
- Eval injection fails due to lexical environment isolation
- Error: "The variable SENSITIVE-DATA is unbound"

### 3. Key Technical Insights
üîç **Isolation Mechanism Works As Expected**
- Each macro creates its own lexical environment
- Variable lookup follows proper scope chain
- No scope bleeding between macro and parent

## Next Steps for IDA Analysis

### Primary Targets for Binary Analysis:
1. **C:\Program Files (x86)\Steel Bank Common Lisp\sbcl.exe**
   - Main SBCL runtime binary
   - Contains macro expansion engine
   - Target for static analysis

### Focus Areas in IDA:
1. **Macro Expansion Functions**
   - How defmacro is processed
   - Macro code transformation
   - Variable substitution mechanism

2. **Lexical Environment Management**
   - Scope creation and destruction
   - Variable binding storage
   - Symbol table isolation

3. **Memory Management**
   - Stack frame allocation
   - Variable storage patterns
   - Cleanup mechanisms

### Vulnerability Research Angles:
1. **Stack Exhaustion** - Deep macro nesting
2. **Buffer Overflow** - Large variable names/values
3. **Symbol Table Corruption** - Malformed macro definitions
4. **Memory Leaks** - Improper cleanup of macro variables

## Research Questions to Investigate:

### 1. How does SBCL implement lexical environment isolation?
- Stack-based or heap-based storage?
- Reference counting or garbage collection?
- Symbol table structure and access patterns?

### 2. What are the performance/security tradeoffs?
- How much overhead does isolation add?
- Are there optimization shortcuts that could be exploited?
- Edge cases in isolation implementation?

### 3. Can we find implementation bugs?
- Buffer overflows in symbol handling?
- Integer overflows in nesting depth?
- Race conditions in multi-threaded macro expansion?

## Expected Findings in Binary Analysis:

### Function Categories to Identify:
1. **Core Macro Functions**:
   - EXPAND-MACRO, DEFMACRO handlers
   - Macro transformation routines

2. **Variable Binding Functions**:
   - LET, PROGV implementations
   - Symbol table management

3. **Memory Management**:
   - Allocation/deallocation routines
   - Garbage collection integration

### Memory Layout Patterns:
1. **Lexical Environment Structure**:
   - Parent environment pointers
   - Variable binding arrays
   - Symbol table references

2. **Stack Frame Organization**:
   - Macro parameter storage
   - Local variable allocation
   - Return address protection
