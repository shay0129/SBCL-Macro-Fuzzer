# Advanced Binary Analysis Plan - SBCL Dynamic Binding Vulnerability

## Phase 1: Environment Setup (Week 1)

### 1.1 Binary Preparation
- [ ] Download SBCL source code with debug symbols
- [ ] Compile SBCL with debugging information enabled
  ```bash
  ./make.sh --with-sb-show-assem --with-sb-xref-for-internals
  ```
- [ ] Create minimal test case that reproduces the vulnerability
- [ ] Verify test case triggers the vulnerability consistently

### 1.2 Tools Setup
- [ ] Install IDA Pro with LISP/Functional language plugins
- [ ] Setup Ghidra with custom scripts for LISP analysis
- [ ] Configure GDB with Python scripting for dynamic analysis
- [ ] Setup Wireshark/Process Monitor for system call analysis

### 1.3 Create Baseline Test Case
```lisp
;; minimal_vulnerability_test.lisp
(let ((target-var "PROTECTED"))
  (format t "Before: ~A~%" target-var)
  (proclaim '(special target-var))
  (setf target-var "COMPROMISED")
  (format t "After: ~A~%" target-var))
```

## Phase 2: Static Analysis with IDA Pro (Week 2)

### 2.1 Symbol Table Analysis
- [ ] Locate `proclaim` function implementation in binary
- [ ] Map symbol table data structures
- [ ] Identify binding type storage mechanisms
- [ ] Document memory layout of lexical vs dynamic bindings

### 2.2 Control Flow Analysis
- [ ] Trace execution path of `proclaim` function
- [ ] Identify validation checkpoints (or lack thereof)
- [ ] Map decision trees for binding type changes
- [ ] Create control flow graph for vulnerability path

### 2.3 Cross-Reference Analysis
- [ ] Find all functions that interact with symbol bindings
- [ ] Identify other potential entry points for similar attacks
- [ ] Map the complete attack surface

## Phase 3: Dynamic Analysis with GDB (Week 3)

### 3.1 Runtime Behavior Analysis
```python
# gdb_script.py - Custom GDB script
import gdb

class SBCLSymbolWatcher:
    def __init__(self):
        self.breakpoints = []
    
    def set_proclaim_breakpoint(self):
        # Set breakpoint on proclaim function
        gdb.execute("break proclaim")
    
    def monitor_symbol_table(self):
        # Watch symbol table modifications
        gdb.execute("watch symbol_table")
    
    def trace_binding_changes(self):
        # Track lexical->dynamic transitions
        pass
```

### 3.2 Memory Analysis
- [ ] Monitor heap/stack changes during vulnerability trigger
- [ ] Track symbol table modifications in real-time
- [ ] Document memory corruption patterns (if any)
- [ ] Analyze performance impact of binding changes

### 3.3 Advanced Exploitation Research
- [ ] Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- [ ] Attempt to escalate beyond simple variable access
- [ ] Research potential for arbitrary code execution
- [ ] Document reliability and reproducibility metrics

## Phase 4: Deep Dive Analysis (Week 4)

### 4.1 Assembly-Level Understanding
- [ ] Disassemble critical functions with detailed annotations
- [ ] Create assembly-level proof of concept
- [ ] Document exact instruction sequences for the attack
- [ ] Identify potential patch points

### 4.2 Root Cause Analysis
- [ ] Pinpoint exact location of missing validation
- [ ] Compare with secure implementations in other compilers
- [ ] Analyze design decisions that led to vulnerability
- [ ] Research historical context and evolution

### 4.3 Mitigation Research
- [ ] Develop proof-of-concept patches
- [ ] Test patch effectiveness
- [ ] Analyze performance impact of fixes
- [ ] Document recommended secure coding practices

## Phase 5: Advanced Research & Documentation (Week 5)

### 5.1 Exploit Development
- [ ] Create reliable weaponized exploit
- [ ] Test across different SBCL versions
- [ ] Document attack vectors and prerequisites
- [ ] Develop automated exploitation tools

### 5.2 Comprehensive Documentation
- [ ] Technical deep-dive blog post with assembly code
- [ ] IDA Pro project files with annotations
- [ ] GDB scripts for reproduction
- [ ] Video walkthrough of the analysis process

### 5.3 Research Paper Quality Output
- [ ] Abstract and methodology section
- [ ] Related work comparison
- [ ] Detailed technical findings
- [ ] Impact assessment and recommendations

## Tools & Scripts to Develop

### IDA Pro Scripts
```python
# ida_sbcl_analyzer.py
import ida_bytes
import ida_name

def find_proclaim_function():
    """Locate proclaim function in binary"""
    pass

def analyze_symbol_table_structure():
    """Map SBCL's internal symbol table"""
    pass

def trace_vulnerability_path():
    """Highlight vulnerable code paths"""
    pass
```

### GDB Analysis Scripts
```python
# advanced_gdb_analysis.py
def setup_sbcl_debugging():
    """Configure GDB for SBCL analysis"""
    pass

def monitor_binding_changes():
    """Real-time binding modification tracking"""
    pass

def capture_exploitation_trace():
    """Document complete attack flow"""
    pass
```
