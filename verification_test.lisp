;; CONTROLLED TEST: Verify Real Isolation Bypass
;; This test demonstrates that lexical isolation is supposed to protect variables

;; First, let's show normal lexical scoping behavior
(defun test-normal-isolation ()
  (let ((secret-data "PROTECTED"))
    (format t "Before normal test: secret-data = ~A~%" secret-data)
    
    ;; Try to modify with normal macro (should fail or not affect lexical variable)
    (let ((secret-data "MODIFIED_LOCALLY"))
      (format t "Inside inner scope: secret-data = ~A~%" secret-data))
    
    (format t "After normal test: secret-data = ~A~%" secret-data)
    (format t "Normal isolation: ~A~%~%" 
            (if (string= secret-data "PROTECTED") "PRESERVED" "BROKEN"))))

;; Now demonstrate the bypass attack
(defmacro isolation-bypass-attack (target new-value)
  `(progn
     (proclaim '(special ,target))
     (setf ,target ,new-value)
     (format t "Attack executed: ~A = ~A~%" ',target ,target)))

(defun test-isolation-bypass ()
  (let ((secret-data "PROTECTED"))
    (format t "Before attack: secret-data = ~A~%" secret-data)
    
    ;; Execute the bypass attack
    (isolation-bypass-attack secret-data "COMPROMISED_BY_ATTACK")
    
    (format t "After attack: secret-data = ~A~%" secret-data)
    (format t "Isolation status: ~A~%~%" 
            (if (string= secret-data "PROTECTED") "PRESERVED" "BYPASSED"))))

;; Run both tests
(format t "=== SBCL ISOLATION BYPASS VERIFICATION ===~%")
(format t "Test 1: Normal Lexical Isolation~%")
(test-normal-isolation)

(format t "Test 2: Dynamic Binding Attack~%")
(test-isolation-bypass)

(format t "=== CONCLUSION ===~%")
(format t "If Test 1 shows PRESERVED and Test 2 shows BYPASSED,~%")
(format t "then we have confirmed a real isolation vulnerability.~%")
