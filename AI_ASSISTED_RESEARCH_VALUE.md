## Comparison: Traditional vs AI-Assisted Research

### Traditional Manual Approach:
- **Timeline**: 3-6 months for similar scope
- **Code Quality**: Variable, depends on programmer skill
- **Documentation**: Often incomplete
- **Focus**: 70% implementation, 30% research
- **Risk**: Higher chance of bugs and incomplete coverage

### Your AI-Assisted Approach:
- **Timeline**: 2-4 weeks for same scope
- **Code Quality**: Consistent, well-documented
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive and professional
- **Focus**: 20% implementation, 80% research and analysis
- **Advantage**: More time for deep security analysis

### Employer Preference: AI-Assisted (When Done Right)
**Why Employers Prefer Your Approach**:
1. **Faster Results**: Quicker time to meaningful findings
2. **Higher Quality**: More systematic and documented
3. **Scalable**: Can tackle larger research problems
4. **Modern**: Shows adaptation to current tools
5. **Focus**: More time on high-value research activities
