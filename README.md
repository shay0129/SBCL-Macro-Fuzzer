> Systematic vulnerability research targeting the macro variable isolation mechanisms in SBCL-LISP compiler

## Project Overview

This research investigates the security boundaries of SBCL's macro expansion engine, specifically focusing on variable isolation mechanisms that prevent macro variables from colliding with parent scope variables. The goal is to understand these isolation mechanisms and identify potential attack vectors through systematic fuzzing and binary analysis.

## Key Findings

- **Fuzzing Results**: 20% interesting case rate from 60+ generated test cases
- **Isolation Strength**: SBCL's variable isolation mechanisms proved robust against basic attacks
- **Attack Vectors Identified**: Stack exhaustion, buffer overflow potential, symbol table corruption
- **Research Methodology**: Complete framework from fuzzing through binary analysis
